## Framework for PHP and Vue2

---

## What is Phoenix PHP?

This framework was created to just start developing with PHP and Vue without setting up a node or inertia server or
whatever else makes Vue work with PHP. So if for example you just have an Apache Webserver running and you want to use
Vue.js as a template engine with your working setup this framework is just for you.

## Installation

### Using the Demo Project

In case you don't want to use composer you can also use the example project and start from
there: [Demo Project](https://github.com/ArthegaAsdweri/phoenix-php-template).

> git clone git@github.com:ArthegaAsdweri/phoenix-php-template.git

Install dependencies by running:

> composer install

### Using Docker

You find a working Docker configuration including docker-compose file in the [Demo Project](https://github.com/ArthegaAsdweri/phoenix-php-template).

### Manual Installation

Adding the dependency will automatically set up your includes.

> composer require arthega-asdweri\phoenix-php

Using the manual installation will require you to set up the project directory manually. This is not recommended because
it might result in unexpected errors and will basically take you much longer than using the demo project.
